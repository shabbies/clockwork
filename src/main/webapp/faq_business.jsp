                        <dd>Our system is dependent on a ratings system to ensure that you can hire the best help available to you. Therefore, we request that all employers rate your acquired help by simply marking their services as good, neutral or bad. Please also note that you will not be able to post any new job until you have rated all your past hired help!</dd>

                        <dt>Q) Why can't I withdraw my job offer after the job-seeker accepts?</dt>
                        <dd>We want to simplify the entire hiring process by streamlining it and reduce unnecessary checks and interviews. If you still want to withdraw your job offer after the job-seeker accepts, please do send us a email stating your reason and we will handle it for you!</dd>
